## Key features
### 1. Each user truly own their profiles, posts and comments
In addition to the obvious advantages of direct ownership, this also allows users to use information (such as profiles, posts, followings, followers, etc.) from our platform anywhere else.  
### 2. Editable content
In contrast to some other existing decentralized platforms, every item on SuiMeet is editable. Spotted a mistake or changed your mind? You can easily remove and redo your post or profile!
### 3. Fully on-chain 
SuiMeet is a fully on-chain app. This property ensures it's completely transparent and decentralized.
### 4. Censorship-resistance
Preserve privacy and anonymity, and don't be afraid to be banned because of your thoughts.
